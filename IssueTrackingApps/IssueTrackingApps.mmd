WebWork
As JIRA is a web application, users interact with JIRA using a web browser. JIRA uses OpenSymphony's WebWork 1 to process web requests submitted by users. Please note that WebWork 1, not 2, is used. WebWork 1 is a MVC framework similar to Struts. Each request is handled by a WebWork action which usually uses other objects, such as utility and Manager classes to accomplish a task.
JIRA uses JSP for the View layer. So most of HTML that is served to the user as the response to their web request is generated by a JSP. Therefore, to generate a response the WebWork action uses a JSP.
