# Learn Apache Spark From Scratch

### Clustering

- Clustering [Spark doc: Clustering](https://spark.apache.org/docs/1.1.0/mllib-clustering.html)
- refers to a set of specific  algorithms
- spark most commonly uses k-means
- classes of clustering algorithms
- eg hierarchical clustering
- eg statistical clustering (k-means)
- combination of the two
- visualization tools

### Machine Learning
refers to a set of algorithms and conceptual  frameworks
[algorithms](https://spark.apache.org/docs/1.1.0/mllib-guide.html)
conceptual  frameworks supervised. semi-supervised, …. in the end comes down to a mathematical domain for the conceptual basis of the algorithm.

### Data Science and Analysis
refers to a set of algorithms and conceptual frameworks and tools
Learning objective 1
To be able to describe Apache Spark as a solution in a given context. Clustering, Machine Learning, Data Science and Analysis, …..
1.	Clustering applications, eg remove duplicates
2.	Machine Learning Mlib, training, recommendations
3.	Spark components, Shark, GraphX
4.	Runtime Modes, StandAlone, Yarn Cluster, Mesos Cluster
